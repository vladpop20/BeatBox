# BeatBox

Put checkmarks in the boxes for each of the 16 'beats'. For example, on beat 1 (of 16) the Bass drum and the Hand Clap will play, 
on beat 2 nothing, and on beat 3 the MAracas and Closed Hi-Hat, etc.

When you hit 'Start', it plays your pattern in a loop, until you hit 'Stop' button.

This is the version 1.
